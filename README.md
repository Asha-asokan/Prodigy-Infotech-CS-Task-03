It provides feedback on how to improve the password and classifies its strength as "Very Strong," "Strong," "Moderate," "Weak," or "Very Weak."

Includes at least one special character (e.g., @, #, !, etc.).
- Based on the criteria met, it classifies the password strength as:
Very Strong: All criteria are met.
Strong: Four out of five criteria are met.
Moderate: Three out of five criteria are met.
Weak: Two out of five criteria are met.
Very Weak: One or no criteria are met.
